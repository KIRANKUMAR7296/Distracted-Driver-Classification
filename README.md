# Distracted Driver Multi Action Classification ðŸš—ðŸš™ðŸšŒ

### 1. Problem

Predict the **Likelihood** : What the **Driver** is doing in Each Ricture?

We need to **Classify** Images into following 10 Classes 

- c0: Safe Driving
- c1: Texting (Right) 
- c2: Talking on the Phone (Right)
- c3: Texting (Left)
- c4: Talking on the Phone (Left)
- c5: Operating the Radio
- c6: Drinking
- c7: Reaching Behind
- c8: Makeup
- c9: Talking to Pessenger

### 2. Data

**[Kaggle's State Farm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data)**

### 3. Features

Data consist of Driver Images, each taken in A Car with A Driver doing something in the Car 
- Texting 
- Eating 
- Talking on the Phone
- Makeup
- Reaching Behind (Reaching for some Object on the Back Seat) 

### 4. Files 
1. **imgs.zip** - Zipped Folder of All (Train/Test) Images.
2. **sample_submission.csv** - Sample Submission File in the Correct Format.
3. **driver_imgs_list.csv** - List of Training Images, their subject (Driver) ID, and Class ID.

### 5. Libraries
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Sklearn
5. Keras ( Util )
6. Tensorflow

**tf.keras.utils.to_categorical**

- Converts a **Class Vector** (integers) to **Binary Class** `Matrix`.
